        <p>Look at this copypasta I found.</p>
        <p>edit: I did not make it though.</p>
        <p>
          What the [REDACTED] did you just [REDACTED] say about me, you little
          donkey? I'll have you know I graduated top of my class in the Navy
          Sealions, and I've been involved in numerous secret raids on Donkey
          Kong, and I have over 300 confirmed kills. I am trained in gorilla
          warfare and I'm the top sniper in the entire US armed forces. You are
          nothing to me but just another target. I will wipe you the [REDACTED]
          out with precision the likes of which has never been seen before on
          this Earth, mark my [REDACTED] words. You think you can get away with
          saying that [REDACTED] to me over the Internet? Think again,
          [REDACTED]er. As we speak I am contacting my secret network of spies
          across the USA and your IP is being traced right now so you better
          prepare for the storm, maggot. The storm that wipes out the pathetic
          little thing you call your life. You're [REDACTED] dead, kid. I can be
          anywhere, anytime, and I can kill you in over seven hundred ways, and
          that's just with my bare hands. Not only am I extensively trained in
          unarmed combat, but I have access to the entire arsenal of the United
          States Marine Corps and I will use it to its full extent to wipe your
          miserable face off the face of the continent, you little [REDACTED].
          If only you could have known what unholy retribution your little
          "clever" comment was about to bring down upon you, maybe you would
          have held your [REDACTED] tongue. But you couldn't, you didn't, and
          now you're paying the price, you goddamn idiot. I will [REDACTED] fury
          all over you and you will drown in it. You're [REDACTED] dead, kiddo.
